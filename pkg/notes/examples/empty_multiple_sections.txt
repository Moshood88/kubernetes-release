SkipHealthzCheck snuck in there while I was working on the test for #123003, but is ultimately not necessary to test the functionality. Somehow it merged despite failing the goroutine leak check fairly often on my machine

skipping healthz check resulted in leaking goroutines from poststarthooks sometimes when running TestCRDsOnStartup. Manually tested with stress that it no longer flakes (and that it did flake before).

before:

```
1m0s: 8 runs so far, 8 failures (100.00%)
1m5s: 8 runs so far, 8 failures (100.00%)
1m10s: 8 runs so far, 8 failures (100.00%)
1m15s: 8 runs so far, 8 failures (100.00%)
```

after

```
30s: 3 runs so far, 0 failures
35s: 5 runs so far, 0 failures
40s: 13 runs so far, 0 failures
45s: 13 runs so far, 0 failures
50s: 13 runs so far, 0 failures
55s: 13 runs so far, 0 failures
1m0s: 15 runs so far, 0 failures
```
