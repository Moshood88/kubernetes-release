This repo contains the tooling and infrastructure configurations for creating
Kubernetes releases from the [kubernetes/kubernetes] main repository.

There are several scripts and helpers in this repository a Release Manager will
find useful when managing all kinds of releases (alpha, beta, official, rc)
across branches.

Golang-based tools can be built via the `compile-release-tools` script.
Individual tools can be installed via `go install k8s.io/release/cmd/$TOOL@latest`.
